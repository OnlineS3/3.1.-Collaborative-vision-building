        <h1>The Collaborative Vision Building Tool</h1>
        <h2>What does the Collaborative Vision Building Tool do?</h2>
        <p>Collaborative Vision Building is a process by which multiple people work together to define an ideal goal or
            end state for a project, this is called a Vision. When the Vision is clearly defined as a short concise
            statement, this is called a Vision Statement. The Collaborative Vision Building Tool has been designed
            in order to help you consult with others when creating a Vision.</p>
        <h2>When should I use this tool?</h2>
        <p>If multiple people are working on the same project and you need to decide what the final outcome of the
            project is.</p>
        <h2>How do I use the tool?</h2>
        <p>The Collaborative Vision Building process is divided into 6 separate steps. In some steps multiple people
            work together and in other steps one person combines the inputs from previous steps into a single input.</p>
        <p>The first step is to define the project and describe what the project will be.</p>
        <p>In step 2, multiple people can each propose a Vision Statement that will be compiled and reviewed in a later
            step.</p>
        <p>In step 3, the creator of the project reviews all of the suggested Vision Statements and tries to combine
            all the suggestions into 1 all encompassing Vision Statement. This Vision Statement is still a Draft, and
            is liable to change in subsequent steps.</p>
        <p>In step 4, all participants join a live chat and discuss the current Draft Vision Statement. They discuss
            what they agree or disagree with and suggest any changes that may be made to it and the reasons the changes
            should be made.</p>
        <p>In step 5, the creator of the project reviews the discussion and makes any changes to the Draft Vision
            Statement that they think is necessary. Finally, the creator creates a small report that explains the
            decisions they made in making changes to the Draft Vision Statement.</p>
        <p>Finally, in step 6, the Vision Statement is finalized and a document is generated that summarizes the
        steps that were taken during the process.</p>
{% comment %}        <p>This method supports reaching  a shared vision for a topic by gathering views from stakeholders through a
            structured collaborative vision building process.
            <br />
            This process encompasses the creation of a "vision building session" for collaborative vision building, the
            elicitation and gathering of input from stakeholders joining vision sessions, the proposal of a vision
            session, the discussion of the proposed vision session and the generation of a final vision statement.
            <br />
            This tool, the Collaborative Vision Building tool, facilitates this process online and provides a means to
            document what happened during the process. Facilitators of a vision building process can start a vision
            building procedure through which stakeholders can provide input and discuss proposed vision statements.
